# Fractals in Pascal’s Triangle
For this project, I studied the fractal patterns hidden
in Pascal’s triangle. I wrote a computer program to make the
plots of Pascal’s triangle modulo a number. When sufficiently
many rows are plotted, I could see different fractal patterns for
all natural numbers greater than 1. I divided the numbers into
three categories: prime numbers, powers of prime numbers and
other composite numbers, and discussed them respectively. My
aim was to explain and justify some of my observations using
properties of Pascal’s triangle and theorems in number theory.
I was inspired by a proof of Fermat’s Little Theorem Michael
Frame gave in his book, where he proved the theorem by counting
the fixed points in baker map. This might not seem relevant to
our topic but I found it extremely fascinating to see how different
mathematical theories like number theory and fractal geometry
can be related.
